## 🌟 Overview
This project aims to build a robust image classification model to identify various spices, including Jahe (Ginger) and Lengkuas (Galangal), along with an "Unknown" category. By using CNNs, the model can learn and distinguish between different spice types with high accuracy. The project is developed using TensorFlow and executed on Google Colab.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of different spices, including Jahe (Ginger), Lengkuas (Galangal), and an "Unknown" category.

- **Source:** Stored on [Google Drive](insert_google_drive_link_here)
- **Format:** Images in JPEG/PNG format
- **Labels:** Each image is labeled with the corresponding spice type
